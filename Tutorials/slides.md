# Why R?

- Easy-to-learn language
- Specially popular in economics and health sciences
- Scalable to big-data ecosystems like Spark

- Large community behind it, constant and steady development
- Used in leading research institutions and universities around the world
- Available in all platforms
- Free

---

# Why R...

## instead of Stata?
- Freely available
- No OS limitations

## instead of Python?
- More common among finance and economics topics
- Easier to install and set-up (out-of-the-box)

---

# RStudio

- Best IDE (integrated development environment) for R
- All-in-one: Editor, console, viewer, data and document manager 
- Perfect integration with Git

---

# Basic R

- We assign variables with `<-`, `->` or `=`. Doing `x = 1`, `x <- 1` or `1 -> x` are exactly equivalent. You can define several variables at once: `x <- y <- z <- 1`.
- Boolean operators are `==`, `>`, `<`, `|`. To negate any of the former, we use `!`.
- Functions follow this structure: `some_function(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)` 
- Conditional statements can be done by using: `if(conditions) {do this}`. Similar syntax applies for loops: `for(i in set) {do this}`, where `i` is a variable inside the loop that will still exist when it ends.
- Packages are loaded by running `library(package_name)`, and installed by `install.packages("package_name")` (note the quotes!)

# The 'tidyverse'

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/#installation-and-use) environment is a set of packages that has become one of the most complete and powerful solutions available in R to do anything related to data cleaning and visualization. It is based on:

- A concrete *grammar* of data manipulation with which code can be written in a sentence-like manner, making it easily readible and very intuitive. 
- The concept of *tidy* data: All columns are variables, are rows are observations.
- *Vectorised* operations: No more time-consuming ugly-looking loops.

**The basic idea is to concatenate a series of verbs (functions) to manipulate the data by creating a `pipe`, using the *pipe operator* `%>%`**


---

# Load the data

When loading the tidyverse, the `readr` package will be automatically loaded too. It allows us to read csv files by using the command `read_csv("file.csv")`.

Should we have other formats of data, additional packages are included, such as `readxl` for excel spreadsheets and `haven` for Stata or SPSS files. They just need to be loaded and then can be used the same way, that is, by using the command `read_*("file.*")` and replacing `*` by the desired extension.

**Good news:** We can export the resulting data using the same command but replacing `read` by `write`.

---
# Load the data

```R
library(tidyverse)

read_csv("exampleData.csv") -> csv_data
read_csv("exampleData.dta") -> dta_data
read_csv("exampleData.xls") -> excel_data
```

---

# Manage the data

The `dplyr` package from the tidyverse is the main workhorse regarding data manipulation. 

## Data browsing

# Manage the data

## Data manipulation

There are two kind of functions to be used: *summary* functions (which retrieves information from all data points) or *vectorised* functions (which applies a transformation to each data point) to be used and then the operation to be performed. 

---

# Manage the data

So far it looks quite similar to any other possible language, but when we put things together, is when the magic kicks in:

```

```

Why can this method be more efficient? Because it does what is called *lazy* evaluation, that is, it executes the commands sentence once it understands all steps it needs to do. It does not load the data,
