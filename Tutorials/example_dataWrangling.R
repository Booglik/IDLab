## Let's focus for now on the temperature, we know in SPb we always have to be
## ready for rain. Thus, the dataset has more columns than we would want to. We
## can keep just a bunch of them by using select()

weather_data %>%
  select(date, week_day, min, max) -> temp_data

temp_data

## Shoud we be interested only on weekends, we can pick observations with 
## filter() and maybe calculate some things
temp_data %>%
  filter(week_day == "Saturday" | week_day == "Sunday")

## Let's first simply calculate the mean minimum temperature on weekends, in two
## different ways (for the sake of understanding how it works)
temp_data %>%
  filter(week_day == "Saturday" | week_day == "Sunday") %>%
  summarise(
    mean_min_1step = mean(min),
    sum_min = sum(min),
    count = n(),
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    mean_min_2steps = sum_min/count
  )
  
## 'Summarise' condenses the dataset into summary statistics. Another example 
## would be to find the coldest temperature of the dataset. For this, we could either 
## just arrange the data or use summarise() to get the minimum temperature:

temp_data %>% 
  arrange(min) %>%
  head() #the head() command shows the first 5 lines of a tibble

temp_data %>% 
  summarise(coldest = min(min))

## As we can see, summarise() drops all non-called columns. We might want, 
## for example, to keep the mean along with the rest of the data to compare it
## to the other days. We do this with the mutate() command, which performs 
## vectorised operations. Let's focus on the minimum temperature again

temp_data %>%
  mutate(mean_min = mean(min)) %>%
  mutate(deviation_min = abs(mean_min - min))
