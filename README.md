### Installing Git

In order to install Git in your laptop, follow the links for [Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.34.1.windows.1) (Select the version that fits your machine, most likely the one reading `Git-2.34.1-64-bit.exe`, and isntall it) and for [MacOS](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) (to my understanding, the easiest solution is the one under the `Binary installer` section, this provides you with a `.dmg` package to install git. I am a foreigner to the Apple ecosystem, so you might find any of the other options better).
